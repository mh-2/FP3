	<ul>
		<li>Harmony is often said to refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from melodic line, or the "horizontal" aspect.</li><br>
		<li>In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities.</li><br>
		<li>In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions".</li><br>
		<li>A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass.</li><br>
		<li>Typically, in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. </li><br>
		<li>Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds.</li><br>
		<li>In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments. </li><br>
